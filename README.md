**Download [flan-t5-xl](https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-xl).**

```python
from transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration
tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained("google/flan-t5-xl")
model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("google/flan-t5-xl")
```
These three lines will download flan-t5-xl to your ~/.cache/huggingface directory.

or 

```python
mkdir pretrained_models/infinity/flan-t5-xl
cd pretrained_models/infinity/flan-t5-xl

huggingface-cli download google/flan-t5-xl --local-dir ./
```
